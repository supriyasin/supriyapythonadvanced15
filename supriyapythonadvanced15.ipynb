    "#1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Python 3.8, released on October 14, 2019, introduced several new features and enhancements. Here are some of the key \n",
    "   features added in Python 3.8:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus operator\"): Python 3.8 introduced the := operator, which allows you to assign \n",
    "       values to variables within expressions. It is useful for assignments within conditional statements and comprehensions.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    2. Positional-only parameters: Python 3.8 introduced the ability to define positional-only parameters in function \n",
    "       signatures. This allows you to specify that certain parameters can only be passed positionally and not as keyword\n",
    "       arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. The f-strings syntax (f\"...\") now supports the = specifier, which allows you to specify the alignment and padding of\n",
    "       formatted values. \n",
    "       \n",
    "    4. The math.prod() function: Python 3.8 introduced the math.prod() function, which returns the product of all the items \n",
    "       in an iterable. It is a convenient way to calculate products without using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. The statistics.mode() function: Python 3.8 added the statistics.mode() function, which returns the most common data \n",
    "       point from a non-empty sequence. It is useful for finding the mode (most frequent value) in a dataset. \n",
    "       \n",
    "    6. The typing.TypedDict class: Python 3.8 introduced the typing.TypedDict class, which allows you to define dictionaries\n",
    "       with specific keys and value types. It provides a way to annotate dictionaries with type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. The asyncio.run() function: Python 3.8 added the asyncio.run() function, which provides a simple way to run a coroutine\n",
    "       and manage the asyncio event loop. It simplifies the process of running asynchronous code. \n",
    "       \n",
    "    8. Improved performance: Python 3.8 included various performance improvements, such as faster f-strings, faster dictionary \n",
    "       access, and more efficient calls to built-in functions like len() and isinstance().\n",
    "\n",
    "  These are just a few highlights of the new features introduced in Python 3.8. There were also other smaller enhancements and\n",
    "  optimizations made in the release.\"\"\""
